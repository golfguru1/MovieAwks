#MovieAwks

MovieAwks is an app that allows users to see how awkward a movie will be to watch with their family/parents. Awkward-ness is rated on a scale of 😇 to 💀 (see below for rating conversion)

I used Firebase as a backend to store all the ratings that users make, and this lovely API: [The Movie DB API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io) which provides both movie info and posters.

###Rating
When rating the awkwardness of a movie, you must chose between 1-10 on the awkward scale:

* 0-1 : not at all awkward 😇
* 2-3 : meh awkward 😐
* 4-5 : getting pretty awkward 😔
* 6-7 : starting to get really uncomfortable 😬
* 8-9 : dangerous territory😵
* 10 : 💀 (skull is self-explanitory)
